# Example "Multi Tenancy Frontend Operator"

The operator simply deploys a frontend application which runs on a nginx server. Therefor the operator creates following Kubernetes resources:

- A deployment
- A service
- Some secrets

The source code of the example frontend application is available in the open sourced GitHub project [multi-tenancy-frontend](https://github.com/IBM/multi-tenancy-frontend).

## The project is related to following blog posts:

### LOCAL DEVELOPMENT

Get the operator running on a local machine and using Kubernetes.
I verified my example project (Multi Tenancy Frontend Operator) also for these topics and it worked for me.
